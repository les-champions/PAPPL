# gPH
The Process Hitting is a recently introduced formalism suited for modelling qualitative dynamics of biological networks. It is a special class of Asynchronous Automata Networks.

**gPH** is a graphical interface for editing Process Hitting models.

[Pint](https://github.com/pauleve/pint/) implements the language, simulation, formal analysis, and translation of Process Hitting models.
